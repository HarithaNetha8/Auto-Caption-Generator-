 Hi everyone, my name is Harita. This is the sample test case, a voice recording for to check auto caption generator.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And I just want to write some, sorry, say some information.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 I was doing this auto caption generator by using the python and by using some libraries called different libraries.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 We are having just need to import that file. Let me explain that what are those files.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 In this we just need to import first one, import viscure and srt and date and time and oes and systems.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We just need to import these things and next we need to go for the further method or functions.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Writing that, matching the path name, file name is it okay or not.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Which will generate a file not for error or error loading viscure model or as file not for error during transcription.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Any other things, but if it successfully completed means it will generate the text as subtitled saved as output with the information captions.satty.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 It is saved in the format of asatty file. So let me check that it will generate the text or not.
